													<h2><a href="#">Groovin' The View<br />
													</a></h2>
												</header>
												<a href="GroovinTheView" class="image fit"><img src="images/music-visualiser.jpg" alt="" /></a>
												<p>This project will be a fun music visualiser that will start as something that
												will make you say "hm, thats pretty cool" to then have it as a background element
											   for the site? Or maybe make a gamemode out of it? Who knows. Details TBC</p>

												</header>
												<a href="invading-space" class="image fit"><img src="images/space-invaders.jpg" alt="" /></a>
												<p>I wanted to use my knowledge of neural nets in some sort of classic game format. Snake has been
												overdone, mario as well. I thought about maybe doodle jump as well? But as a starting point, space invaders (ish)
											   will be fun to muck around with</p>

													<h2><a href="#">Mafia</a></h2>
												</header>
												<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/mafia.jpg" alt="" /></a>
												<p>Mafia is the classic hidden-identity card game where in a group of individuals, some are townsfolk, others are mafia.
												   The town are trying to expose who the mafia are and the mafia are trying to take out the town one by one. In order for mafia
												to run using cards is one player is the NPC narrator that keeps track of what happens and facilitates the game. This web applet does
											this role for you allowing all players to take part in the action.</p>

													<h2><a href="#">Who's listening</a></h2>
												</header>
												<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/whos-there.jpg" alt="" /></a>
												<p>In today's day and age, a classic urban conspiracy is that the big tech companies
												(FB, Google) are always listening to everyone all the time. A typical example of this is when someone
											starts talking about a specific item, let's say ski boots, and suddenly they are flooded with advertising for
										ski boots across their social media apps. This app is simple in premise, in that it shows what things are happening
									under the hood of your phone in terms of processes running, permissions set etc. to clearly show "Who's listening".</p>

													<h2><a href="#">GROW</a></h2>
												</header>
												<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/GROW.jpg" alt="" /></a>
												<p>GROW is an app idea I had when I felt like I had alot of areas of life I wanted to improve on or skills/tasks/projects I
												wanted to build, but quickly feel them fall away after that initial buzz of excitement. GROW will set up a period of time where you want to focus
											on growing one of those things. Similar to the app "Forest" which grows a forest when you set timers, perhaps GROW could grow a series of different things:
										a great oak tree, a tall skyscraper, a monster truck. These things can grow from you picking goals or something idk.</p>

													<h2><a href="#">Qualitative Assessment Metrics For Transfer Learning</a></h2>
												</header>
												<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/TL-robot.png" alt="" /></a>
												<p>Transfer learning (TL) is a deep learning technique which simply takes a network that is really good at learning something and shares it's knowledge with another
												which would otherwise struggle to achieve strong results to improve it's classification significantly. However, neural networks are very black-boxes, in that it is difficult
											to qualitatively determine what is happening when the applications produce these significant results, particularly in TL as it is unclear how to assess it's performance beyond that
										of high-level metrics such as accuracy. My thesis developed several different assessment metrics that provided more qualitative understanding of why different TL applications performed
									the way that they did.</p>
