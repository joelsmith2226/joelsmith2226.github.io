GitHub pages website to showcase resume, projects and give a public avenue to be contacted about professional inquiries.
Go to [joelsmithdev.com](https://joelsmith2226.github.io) to see website. Web development completed using HTML, CSS and JS. Nothin' too fancy. (see [Todoish](https://joelsmithdev.com/Todoish/) for my React adventures)

## Resume

## Projects

The **Projects** page is a dashboard for all the projects that have a current working finished product, projects in development and future project ideas I'd like to work on. It is a springboard to both the code and live versions of these projects.
